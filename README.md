## [Archaeo Jump Drive](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2974656285)

This mod adds a new Jump Drive, gated behind the __Archaeoengineers__ Ascension Perk.

Upon choosing the __Archaeoengineers__ Ascension Perk, an event will fire giving the player the __Ancient Jump Calculations__ technology. If the player already has the __Jump Drive__ technology, then a new rare/dangerous society technology will unlock called __Archaeo Jump Drive__. Once it has been researched, the player will unlock the __Archaeo Jump Drive__ ship component to use on their ships. It is meant to be superior to the Psi Jump Drive, however as of writing the balancing is not final yet and suggestions are welcome.

### Compatibility

This mod overwrites the vanilla __Archaeoengineers__ Ascension Perk and the __Psi Jump Drive__.

### Localization

This mod supports the following languages:

| __Language__  | __Contributor__ |

## [Big Yards Forked](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2976268363)

> Titan Assembly Yards and Colossal Assembly Yards take up starbase building slots and have very high energy costs to maintain, but they don't have a constant benefit to justify keeping them around. That's... kind of weird, right?
\- __Keukotis__

This mod is a fork of the original [Big Yards 3.8](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2975469306) mod by [Keukotis](https://steamcommunity.com/id/Keukotis).

Instead of adding naval capacity to the Titan Assembly Yards and Colossal Assembly Yards, I've added shipyard capacity. The Titan Assembly Yards provide 2 Shipyard Capacity and the Colossal Assembly Yards provide 4 Shipyard Capacity.

### Compatibility

This mod overwrites the ``titan_yards`` and ``colossus_yards`` starbase buildings.
